# vim-keybindings-tips

A simple document that shares some of the features of the VIM editor that we use in day-to-day life. Also, some fancy features.

This repo is currently maintained by Pranjal and I, any one interested in adding his/her ideas and techniques to make VIM more user friendly & boost productivity are more than welcome here.
